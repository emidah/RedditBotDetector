# RedditBotDetector

There's a lot of bots on reddit that basically repost stuff with minimal changes, and have their friend bots comment on them. I suppose this is done to farm karma for nefarious purposes (vote manipulation or something)

This was an attempt at making a bot that would detect those, but I ran out of interest and time in the middle

Running the bot detector on subs like r/nononono always lead to interesting results though

Oh and I had to fork (and fix) the reddit library that this depends on to make this thing work, but that's merged now anyway
